# KA-Challenge-Framework
This my Khan Academy JavaScript roject source code.

### Specifications
For this project, I used EsprimaJS. After looking at structured.js, I decided EsprimaJS would be an adequate tool to use for this project. While provided performance tests by both Acorn and Esprima vary, I found that Esprima's comprehensive examples and simple documentation to be very helpful and easy to adopt.
